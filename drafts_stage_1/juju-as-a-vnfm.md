Purpose - Explore on how to use Juju as a VNFM

# Install Juju

# Charms

Seems it's not possible (or there's no straight method avialable) to deploy an application from QCOW2 images.

Also with Kubernetes are the Juju charms going to replace Kubernetes template files or Helm charts?

Juju could have very specific use cases, but not suitable as a VNFM for most telcos?
