# Introduction to DevSecOps

DevSecOps is a new pardigm that augments DevOps practices by incorporating security. The goal of DevSecOps is to ensure software security without hurting the speed of delivery in DevOps and agile development practices. To achieve this goal, DevSecOps integrates software security into every step of SDLC, and makes security a shared responsibility of everyone involved in the SDLC, instead of an isolated team of security professionals.

Adaptation of DevSecOps practices helps an organization to avoid expensive last minute security fixes in software releases, and ensure timely delivery of secure software resulting in happy customers.

# DevOps vs DevSecOps

Since its inception in 2009, the concept of DevOps has helped shorten the SDLC by combining software development and IT operations, but software security still remained left out. As DevOps and agile practices shortened the software release cycles, security teams found themselves in a constant struggle to keep up, creating a conflict between the software development and security experts.

Before DevOps, there was a similar conflict between the software development and IT operations. They were two dysfunctional units, working in silos, and often had competing goals and objectives. This model was hampering the software release process by adding significant delays and low-quality software releases. The adaptation of DevOps solved this problem by combining the development and operations teams, and moving the operational aspects to the beginning of the SDLC. 

We can consider the SDLC as a process stretched from left to right with planning and design at the left, and build and deployment phases at the right. The DevOps practices effectively moved the operational aspects such as build deployment to the start of the process which is knows as a shift-left pattern.

Same as DevOps solved the problem between developers and IT operations, the DevSecOps concept attempts to solve the conflict between the developers and the security teams by shifting the security aspect also towards the left of the SDLC.
 
# Why should you adapt DevSecOps?

Today's enterprises are powered by software. A security breach could be catastrophic. It can destroy the reputation of an organization in a matter of hours. The hackers, aware of this are hard at work, so software security is of paramount importance.

At the same time, the rapidly transforming business landscapes, demand the software to be adapted to changing business requirements in time. But, timely delivery of software is no longer enough. That software neesds to be secure too. 

While agile and devops approaches help the software engineering teams to quickly adapt to the changes in business requirements, software security is often an overlooked matter in these processes. Even in the agile world, most of the security compliances are still on paper and are manually ticked off at the end of the SDLC. If a security problem is detected at this point, correcting it could be a pricey matter in both time and effort.

DevSecOps practices eliminate this problem, by ingraining security in to every step of SDLC. By taking up the security considerations from the beginning of the SDLC, security gets built in to the software architecture instead of being added on later, as a set of fixes. In DevSecOps security is not an afterthought, but is built in to the software right from the start.

DevSecOps makes everyone responsible for security, reducing friction between development teams and security experts. It help developers view security as an architectural best practice instead of a set of compliances written on paper that needs to be painfully checked in the final product.

Adapting DevSecOps ensure software security while maintaining fast delivery, and avoid situations where certain security checks are bypassed or ignored altogether to meet delivery timelines. 

# How to adapt DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is a combination of culture, tools, and processes. Therefore, a transformation to DevSecOps, requires enhancements in all three aspects.

## Culture

Culture defines the way people think, communicate, and act in an organization. DevSecOps demands a culture of collaboration between the security experts and software developers. In the traditional SDLC, developers were used seeing the security team as a set of adversaries, who stand in the way of delivering the final product. 

The DevSecOps approach demands eliminating this belief, and collaborating with the security experts right from the design phase to make security, a respobsibility of everyone involved in the SDLC. This mindset shift is essential for successfull adaptation of DevSecOps.

## Tools

Automation of security analysis and testing is a key aspect in DevSecOps.  Most organizations still have their security checks written on paper, as a set of compliance items, where they are ticked off manually by evaluating the software, before release. 

This approach will not survive the DevSecOps era. Since it needs the secutiry checks to be done from the start, all the security compliances should be converted to code, so that they can be executed continuousely and automatically at each phase of the developement, and software can be adapted to comply with the secutiry checks. 

To implement this kind of automated security testing, a suitable toolset should be in place. It's true that tools alone will not achieve security, but without proper tools DevSecOps is not going to be successfull either.

## Processes

As a business process, shifting security to the left is the most important aspect of DevSecOps. The actual implementation of this could be hard in practice, since it requires changes in all stages of the SDLC. To make it success the whole team involved in the SDLC must view the software from a broader perspective, over individual or divisional goals.

# Best Practices

Integrating DevSecOps into an organization could be a non trivial task. These are some of the best practices that will help a smooth transformation.

## Get everyone onboard
Having everyone involved is the most important factor for successful DevSecOps adaptation. DevSecOps requires a lot of changes in the way developers and security experts used to work, so resistance may not be uncommon. Raising awareness at an early stages is the best way to get people onboard and ease resistance off. 


## Train and educate developers
Most deveopers are not proficient in software security. DevSecOps requires the developers to understand not only how to write secure code but also a wide variety of security frameworks such as OWASP and NIST.

Therefore, the developers have to go through a steep learning curve to adapt DevSecOps. Educating the developers could help them stay productive from the start of the transformation.

## Automation

DevSecOps depend on automation of security checks. Automation needs to be achieved by proper use of tools in the SDLC. Placing too much emphasis on tools could also hamper productivity of developers. Therefore, it's important to identify the right tool set based on the requirements of the particulr type of software being deveoped.

# Conclusion
DevSecOps is nothing but an enhancement to the DevOps process. Whereas DevOps focuses on shortening the SDLC, the DevSecOps process aims to deliver secure software as quickly as possible.

Adaptation of DevSecOps could be hard at the beginning, but it definitely pays off by enabling you to satisfy your customers with timely software delivery, without compromising security.
