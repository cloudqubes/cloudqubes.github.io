**Telcos make the Intenet a reality, but their future is challenging. A complete revamp is the only way forward, and NFV is here to incite.**

Today's telecom networks are the outcome of multiple technology transformations fueled by innovation through generations. From the manual switching systems, several cycles of change have brought us to the point of full IP based 4G EPC delivering broadband services at more than 100 Mb/s per user. Now we are eyeing on 5G and even beyond.   

# Challenges  

While gazing into this exciting future we must not overlook the challenges that we have to overcome as we go along. The already slender profit margins are even more pressurized by the growing capacity demands and falling prices of broadband data. The rigid network architecture consisting of monolithic hardware-centric applications are hampering our ability of rolling out new digital services. Lack of automation, demand more and more human labor as we expand our network footprint. The application market is dominated by a few specialized telecom vendors, limiting break-through innovations. The challenges are not trivial, so we are in need of some formidable aid.  

# How to overcome?  

At a distance, NFV may look like just another hyped-up technology term, but let's take a closer look. NFV is going to enable us to run our applications in a virtualized cloud computing environment. Simple as that, it creates a plethora of opportunities for cost optimization, automation, and establishing agile operational practices. It also opens up the telecom application development ecosystem for small players, thus fostering ample innovations and fair competition. Literally, NFV can enable us to tackle most of our challenges head-on.  

Can we achieve the same by tweaking the existing network architecture? That's unlikely to be successful with the legacy networks because they lack the distinctive features of agility. The traditional operating model of the telecom networks also discourages an agile workflow.  

That leaves us with only one option; a complete revamp. The development of NFV and its ecosystem make this the perfect time to start that transformation. Even though human nature encourages us to resist change and stay in the comfort zone, we face the risk of extinction by doing so.   

# How can NFV help?  

Unlike other technologies like 3G or 4G, NFV is not going to be just a new roll-out. We have to consider it as a transformation that involves technology, people, and processes. An NFV transformation with the right approach can create an agile operating model that prepares the entire business for future challenges.   

Agility is a key feature that we seriously lack in the telecom networks today. It can be considered as the root cause of most of our challenges. So, let's face the reality and strive to transform, and eliminate the threat of being ended up in dust.   

# Is this the best time?  

In the face of change, the risk of not taking action can be greater than the risk of taking any action even though it may not be the perfectly correct action. If we are to wait until the technology gets mature we will be waiting forever because of the rapid evolution in the technology landscape. It would be best to apply the crawl-walk-run kind of approach and start with what is currently available while keeping room for improvements.    

# What to expect  

Realizing the benefits of NFV requires far more work beyond just deploying a feature-rich NFV platform. We have to make a complete transformation of the skills of our people and processes that we are currently following. Often this would require a lot more work than the technology implementation.  

The right adaptation of NFV can build a sophisticated digital services platform that is capable of exploiting new business opportunities. It can put us on a par with digital players like Netflix or Amazon, enabling us to deliver services with similar agility and efficiency. It will also enable us to enhance the lives of people, and revolutionize multiple other industries.   

Even though the NFV transformation requires substantial investments at the initial state, it would definitely pay off in the long run with new business opportunities.   

The NFV transformation is not going to be the end of a story. It is the beginning of a new story where the cloud and the telecom networks merge to open up a whole new set of opportunities to everyone.
