If you have multiple github accounts, say one for your office and another for personal use you may have found that commiting code from those separate accounts is cumbersome. Git always seems to default to the initially configured user account.

To overcome this problem, you can use SSH to access GitHub. 

A GitHub repo is accessible via either SSH or HTTPS.
